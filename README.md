#### This is a Classification Problem. 

#### The census data belongs to the citizens of US and other countries and having some related information.

#### Here, we have data with 14 features with person details and the income which is >50 0r <=50.

#### we applied Machine learning algorithms to get maximum accuracy to predict the data.

### The Features like -

- Age
- WorkClass
- fnlwgt
- Education
- EducationNum
- MaritalStatus
- Occupation
- Relationship
- Race
- Gender
- CapitalGain
- CapitalLoss
- HoursPerWeek
- NativeCountry 
- Income

#### The Output willbe the "Income" and remaining will be the input.
