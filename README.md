# Census_Income_Prediction-
![](census.jpg)
This is a Classification Problem. 

The census data belongs to the citizens of US and other countries and having some related information.

Here, we have data with 14 features with person details and the income which is >50 0r <=50.

we applied Machine learning algorithms to get maximum accuracy to predict the data.

***The Features like -

Age,

WorkClass,

fnlwgt, 

Education,

EducationNum,

MaritalStatus,

Occupation, 

Relationship,

Race,

Gender,

CapitalGain,
